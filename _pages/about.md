I am a graduated with a bachelor's degree in **Materials Science and Engineering** from [Hebei University of Technology](https://www.hebut.edu.cn), under the guidance of Professor [Qingguo Tang](https://clxy.hebut.edu.cn/szdw/yjy/98915.htm). After graduation, I worked as a high school physics teacher and material journal editor. My current research interest is the **light-matter interaction**.

Feel free to reach out to me anytime via email:

I'm always open to engaging in discussions, collaborations, and sharing insights within the scientific community.
