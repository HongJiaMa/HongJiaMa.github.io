I am a graduated with a bachelor's degree in **Materials Science and Engineering** from [Hebei University of Technology](https://www.hebut.edu.cn), under the guidance of Professor [Qingguo Tang](https://clxy.hebut.edu.cn/szdw/yjy/98915.htm). My current research interests revolve around the precise and efficient simulation of **diabatic dynamics** and **open quantum systems**. I have a strong passion for unraveling the fundamental physical and chemical properties of functional materials. Furthermore, I am deeply fascinated by the intricate world of quantum phenomena, with the aim of deciphering the complex behaviors exhibited within these systems.

Throughout my academic journey, I have built a solid foundation and am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of knowledge. I am committed to contributing to our understanding of quantum dynamics and its applications. **Currently, I am actively seeking a doctoral program where I can further explore and expand upon my research interests.**

Feel free to reach out to me anytime via email:
