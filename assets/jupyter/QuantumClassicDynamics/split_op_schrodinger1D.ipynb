    "The provided code snippet is part of the implementation of the Ehrenfest theorems within the context of simulating the time evolution of a quantum system described by the Schrödinger equation. Let's break down the code and explain how it relates to the Ehrenfest theorems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ehrenfest Theorems Overview**:\n",
    "   The Ehrenfest theorems are fundamental principles in quantum mechanics that provide a connection between the classical and quantum descriptions of a physical system. There are two main Ehrenfest theorems:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **First Ehrenfest Theorem**: It relates the time derivatives of the quantum expectation values of position $x$ and momentum $p$ to the corresponding classical quantities in a classical Hamiltonian system. Mathematically, it states:\n",
    "     - $\\frac{d\\langle x \\rangle}{dt} = \\frac{1}{m}\\langle p \\rangle$\n",
    "     - $\\frac{d\\langle p \\rangle}{dt} = -\\frac{d\\langle V \\rangle}{dx}$\n",
    "     - Here, $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ represents the quantum expectation value, $m$ is the particle mass, and $V$ is the potential energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Second Ehrenfest Theorem**: It relates the time derivative of the quantum expectation value of the Hamiltonian $H$ to the classical Hamiltonian function. Mathematically, it states:\n",
    "     $\\frac{d\\langle H \\rangle}{dt} = \\langle \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} \\rangle$\n",
