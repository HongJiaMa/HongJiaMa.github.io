    "## Obtain Stationary States via Imaginary Time Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Python code defines a class `ImgTimePropagation` that calculates stationary states using imaginary time propagation. This process can be described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Initialize an empty list to store the stationary states: `self.stationary_states = []`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate Through Desired States**:\n",
    "   - For each desired stationary state from 0 to `(nstates-1)`:\n",
    "     - Initialize the wavefunction`$ based on parity:\n",
    "       - If \\(n\\) is even: `wavefunction = exp(-x^2)`\n",
    "       - If \\(n\\) is odd: `wavefunction = x * exp(-x^2)`\n",
    "     - Perform `nsteps` imaginary time steps:\n",
    "       - Multiply the `wavefunction` by `img_exp_v` [$= (-1)^k \\cdot e^{-0.5 \\cdot \\text{dt} \\cdot V}$]to account for the potential energy.\n",
    "       - Transform the `wavefunction` to `momentum representation` using `FFT` and multiply it by `img_exp_k`[$= e^{-\\text{dt} \\cdot K}$] for kinetic energy.\n",
    "       - Transform the `wavefunction` back to the `coordinate representation` using `inverse FFT` and multiply it by `img_exp_v`.\n",
    "     - Normalize the `wavefunction`: $\\text{wavefunction} \\div \\left( \\left\\| \\text{wavefunction} \\right\\| \\cdot \\sqrt{\\text{dx}} \\right)$\n",
    "     - Project out previously obtained stationary states:\n",
    "       - Calculate the projections (`projs`) onto the stationary states.\n",
    "       - $\\text{projs} = \\left[ \\langle \\psi_i, \\text{wavefunction} \\rangle \\cdot \\text{dx} \\right] \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n_{\\text{states}}$ \n",
    "       - Subtract the projections of stationary states to orthogonalize.\n",
    "       - $\\text{For each } i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n_{\\text{states}}: \\text{wavefunction} -= \\text{proj}_i \\cdot \\psi_i$\n",
    "     - Normalize the `wavefunction` again: $\\text{wavefunction} \\div \\left( \\left\\| \\text{wavefunction} \\right\\| \\cdot \\sqrt{\\text{dx}} \\right)$\n",
    "     - Save the obtained stationary state in `self.stationary_states`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process repeats for each desired stationary state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbols and Variables:\n",
    "- `nstates`: Number of stationary states to obtain.\n",
    "- `nsteps`: Number of imaginary time steps.\n",
    "- `wavefunction`: The wavefunction.\n",
    "- `img_exp_v`: Imaginary time exponent of the potential energy.\n",
    "- `img_exp_k`: Imaginary time exponent of the kinetic energy.\n",
    "- `even`: Boolean flag for the parity of the wavefunction.\n",
    "- `self.stationary_states`: List to store stationary states.\n",
